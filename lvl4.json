The decryption should change the characters of the plaintext by 2 positions and then by an additional position for each subsequent character. For example, the first character is shifted by 2, the second by 3, and so on. It is important that the order follows from a-z, then 0-9, and finally the space character. Punctuation marks should be removed and not considered in the encryption process (including their positions). The following plaintext should be used as a string: 'I go to School. I love School.'
